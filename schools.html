We need to create, for students, teachers and parents an environment for the parents to have a look on different types of schools. It will compose of different types of schools in Tanzania (A LEVEL and O LEVEL) in which each school will have different contents like the short history of the school, the pictures of the school environment including the classes and the other areas around the school, the contacts of a specific school will give a chance for parents to communicate with the headmaster or other people for admission. In general will simplify the problem of searching schools.
